# Attribution and Use of AI Tools

This project, **Multi-Modal AI Service**, integrates multiple AI services including large language models and image models through Amazon Bedrock. The development and refinement of this application were supported by the use of AI-assisted development tools and open-source libraries.

## Tools and Services Used

- **ChatGPT by OpenAI (GPT-4o)**: Used throughout the development process to assist with:
  - Debugging Python and Streamlit code
  - Designing prompt templates
  - Structuring project modules and documentation
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Utilized for accessing:
  - **Anthropic Claude** for text summarization and generation
- **ImageNet Model**: For processing images
- **boto3**: For AWS SDK access and Bedrock integration
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based user interface

## Contributions of AI Assistance

- Generating app architecture
- Creating prompt structures for multi-modal inputs
- Debugging runtime errors and resolving API usage issues


## Authorship Statement

The project author retains full responsibility for the design, writing, integration, testing, and ethical use of the code and AI models. All code generated with AI assistance was carefully reviewed, modified as needed, and integrated into a secure, privacy-respecting system.
